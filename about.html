        <h2>Hello,I'm Alice</h2>
        <p>I'm a non-code developer who loves building easy to use websites and tools.I've worked on projects like mummy island,using tools like Bubble.io.           I enjoy solving problems,designing simple and effective soluyions,and helping ideas come to life without writing any code.     When i'm not working,I like learning new things and exploring creative projects.I'm excited to work on more projects and grow my skills.I believe that no code development is a game changer,making technology more accesible to everyone.My approach focuses on functionality,clean design,and creating solutions tailored meet user needs.Whether it's simplifying workflows or building entirely new systems,i'm always eager to take on challenges that push me to think outside the box.     I am skilled in html,css and figma with experience in designing responsive web pages and creating user-friendly interfaces.</p>
